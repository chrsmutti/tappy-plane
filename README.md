# TappyPlane

[Tappy Plane](https://chrsmutti.itch.io/tappy-plane) is an arcade game where the objective is to avoid rocks and go as far as you can with 
your unbelievably unsafe plane. How many rocks can you avoid?

Made with Godot as a learning experiment, code is experimental, not yet refactored. Went through
with it as a form of forcing me to release what I consider a full game and learn the Godot Engine.
